Advent of Code 2024 - Java Solutions ðŸŽ„

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that takes place every December, featuring a series of fun and engaging puzzles for programmers of all skill levels. You can solve the puzzles in any programming language you like.

This year, my friends and I decided to take on the challenge using Java. Iâ€™ll be sharing my solutions in this repository as I work through the puzzles. Check out Advent of Code here: https://adventofcode.com/
